Hi there! I'm Furkan KalabalÄ±k, and I've been in the software game for over 4 years. Right now, I'm working as a Senior Software Development Specialist at Timus Networks in Istanbul. My main gig involves automating stuff and diving into cloud technologies. I use tools like Ansible and Terraform to make things run smoother and faster. Plus, I'm big on Oracle Cloud projects and tweaking workflows with Jenkins and Bash.

Before Timus, I was a software engineer at Accenture and Andasis, where I got cozy with C++ and learned the ins and outs of tools like CMake and RPM packaging. I'm also pretty handy with Linux systems, always trying to level up my skills.

I'm all about learning and teamwork. Got a cool project? I'm all ears and ready to jump in!
